# Machine-Learning-Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis
This project applies various machine learning models to the Breast Cancer Dataset from the `sklearn` library. It trains 7 different algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Artificial Neural Networks, and compares their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, displaying the results in visual plots.
